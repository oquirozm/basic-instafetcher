# basic-instafetcher
Tiny utility to get up to the most recent 12 posts of any Instagram account in your HTML.

TO DO:
- Create 2 more files: just_instafetch.js, npm_instafetch.js. The first one is to make it easy to just copy and paste the code to wherever you want. The second is to make it consumable via ES6 import.
- Restructure the code to be inside an object (let app = app || {})
- Create props to have a public API that allows to: say if I want to output <a> tags, say what classes should the <img> tags have, say how many images (up to 12) I want to get, say the resolution I want to get, say if I just want to return links, to pass the ID of the container I want to use it for,
